      <h3>About</h3>
      <p>
        Located in modern Syria, Dura-Europos is an exceptional site within
        Mediterranean archaeology, perhaps most notably for the partial survival
        of organic materials. With few exceptions, organic material from the
        ancient Mediterranean is preserved consistently only in Egypt, granting
        Dura-Europos a privileged position in testing the broader applicability
        of Egyptian evidence. This unique status of Dura-Europos is further
        heightened by its relatively undisturbed state of preservation, its
        abrupt and finite end, and the comparatively sophisticated archaeology
        employed at the site during its initial stage of excavation in
        comparison to other Egyptian sites that were often hastily stripped bare
        in search for Pharaonic materials and papyri. This project, centered
        around Dura-Europosâ€™ invaluable corpus of texts written on organic
        media, i.e., papyri and parchment, is guided by the unusual possibility
        of combining digital humanistic approaches with a relatively detailed
        archaeological record in the study of these texts. We seek to create new
        digital tools that enable new perspectives on this corpus and might be
        of interest to a broad array of audiences.

      <h3>How to use the tool:</h3>

      If you are reading this, that means you have downloaded the full
      repository containing the application. With it should be a file in the
      'raw' folder named 'data.csv.' Use the upload tool below to load in this
      file; this should populate the database will nearly 200 Dura Papyri. From
      there, feel free to explore! Currently, we have two main tools for
      exploration: a map tool, and a timeline. The map tool will allow you to
      view artifacts by find spot, while the timeline will allow you to filter
      by date of the artifact (use, not discovery).
